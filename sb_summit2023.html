              <p class="justified large">
                SpeechBrain has established itself as a leading deep learning toolkit
                for speech processing in recent years, with impressive usage statistics
                to back it up. With an average of 100 daily clones and 1000 daily
                downloads on its GitHub repository, along with over 6,000 stars and 1100
                forks, SpeechBrain is a popular choice among speech processing
                experts.
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p class="justified large">
                    In this summit, we are excited to share the latest developments and
                    updates on the SpeechBrain project, engage in an open and collaborative
                    discussion with the community, and introduce it to a broader audience of
                    speech professionals. We would like participants to stay up-to-date with
                    the latest advancements made in SpeechBrain and speech processing
                    technology. We also wish to gather, more interactively, the feedback
                    from the community to better plan future developments. The event will
                    take place four days after the main conference on August 28th.
                </p>
                <br> 

                <p class="justified large"> We are passionate about organizing this event for several reasons: <br/><br/>
                    <b>•</b> The field of speech technology has seen tremendous growth in recent
                    years. Our goal is to keep the community informed about the latest
                    developments and future plans for the SpeechBrain project. We also aim
                    to engage in an open dialogue with the community to set ambitious goals
                    for the project’s future. <br/><br/>
                    <b>•</b> We are excited to bring together experts from both industry and
                    academia to showcase their impactful projects and share their knowledge
                    with the community.<br/><br/>
                    <b>•</b> This event is not only an opportunity to learn and stay updated, but also to network and connect with like-minded individuals in the SpeechBrain community. 
                    The core idea is to avoid missing this chance to be a part of shaping the future of speech technologies and building valuable connections within the community.
